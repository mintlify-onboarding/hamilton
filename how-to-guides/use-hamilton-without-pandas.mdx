Not only can hamilton functions output any valid python object, but Hamilton
also naturally integrates with a few dataframe libraries.

In this example, we rebuild the hello_world example using the polars library.

Note that we are currently working on other examples, including one for pyspark
(Hamilton already has native
[pandas-on-spark](https://github.com/DAGWorks-Inc/hamilton/tree/main/examples/spark)
support).
