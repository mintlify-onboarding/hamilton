title: "Customizing Execution"
description: "The stock Hamilton Driver by default has the following behaviors:"
---

1. It is single threaded, and runs on the machine you call execute from.
2. It is limited to the memory available on your machine.
3. `execute()` by default returns a pandas DataFrame.

To change these behaviors, we need to introduce two concepts:

1. A Result Builder – this is how we tell Hamilton what kind of object we want
   to return when we call `execute()`.
2. A Graph Adapters – this is how we tell Hamilton where and how functions
   should be executed.

## Result Builders

In effect, this is a class with a static function, that takes a dictionary of
computed results, and turns it into something.

```py
class ResultMixin(object):
    """Base class housing the static function.

    Why a static function? That's because certain frameworks can only pickle a static function, not an entire
    object.
    """
    @staticmethod
    @abc.abstractmethod
    def build_result(**outputs: typing.Dict[str, typing.Any]) -> typing.Any:
        """This function builds the result given the computed values."""
        pass
```

So we have a few implementations see
[Result Builders](/api-reference/result-builders) for the list.

To use it, it needs to be paired with a GraphAdapter - onto the next section!

## Graph Adapters

Graph Adapters adapt the Hamilton DAG, and change how it is executed. They all
implement a single interface called `base.HamiltonGraphAdapter`. They are called
internally by Hamilton at the right points in time to make execution work. The
link with the Result Builders, is that GraphAdapters need to implement a
`build_result()` function themselves.

```py
class HamiltonGraphAdapter(ResultMixin):
    """Any GraphAdapters should implement this interface to adapt the HamiltonGraph for that particular context.

    Note since it inherits ResultMixin -- HamiltonGraphAdapters need a `build_result` function too.
    """
    # four functions not shown
```

The default GraphAdapter is the `base.SimplePythonDataFrameGraphAdapter` which
by default makes Hamilton try to build a `pandas.DataFrame` when `.execute()` is
called.

If you want to tell Hamilton to return something else, we suggest starting with
the `base.SimplePythonGraphAdapter` and writing a simple class & function that
implements the `base.ResultMixin` interface and passing that in. See
[Graph Adapters](/api-reference/graph-adapters) and
[Result Builders](/api-reference/result-builders) for options.

Otherwise, let’s quickly walk through some options on how to execute a Hamilton
DAG.

### Local Execution

You have two options:

1. Do nothing – and you’ll get `base.SimplePythonDataFrameGraphAdapter `by
   default.
2. Use `base.SimplePythonGraphAdapter` and pass in a subclass of
   `base.ResultMixin` (you can create your own), and then pass that to the
   constructor of the Driver.

```py Example
adapter = base.SimplePythonGraphAdapter(base.DictResult())
dr = driver.Driver(..., adapter=adapter)
```

By passing in `base.DictResult()` we are telling Hamilton that the result of
execute() should be a dictionary with a map of output to computed result.

### Scaling Hamilton: Multi-core & Distributed Execution

This functionality is currently in an “experimental” state. We think the code is
solid, but it hasn’t been used in a production environment for long. Thus the
API to these GraphAdapters might change.

See the
[experimental](https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton/tree/main/hamilton/experimental)
package for the current implementations. We encourage you to give them a spin
and provide us with feedback. See
[Graph Adapters](/api-reference/graph-adapters) for more details.
