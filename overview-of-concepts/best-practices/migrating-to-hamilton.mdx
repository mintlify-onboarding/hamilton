## Continuous Integration for Comparisons

Create a way to easily & frequently compare results.

1. Integrate with continuous integration (CI) system if you can.
2. 🔎🐛 Having a means that tests code early & often will helps diagnose bugs in
   your old code (most likely) or your new implementation (less likely).
3. Specifically, have a system to compare the output of your Hamilton code, to
   compare to the output of your existing system.

## Integrate into your code base via a “custom wrapper object”

If you have existing systems that you want to integrate Hamilton into, it might
require non-trivial effort for you to change those systems to be able to use
Hamilton. If that’s the case, then we suggest creating a “custom object” to
“wrap” Hamilton, so that it’s easier to migrate to it.

Specifically, this custom wrapper object class’s purpose is to match your
existing API expectations. It will act as the translation layer from your
existing API expectations, to what running Hamilton requires, and back. In
Hamilton terminology, this is a Custom Driver Wrapper, since it wraps around the
Hamilton Driver class.

This is a best practice because:

1. When migrating, it’s best to avoid making too many changes. So don’t change
   your API expectations if you can.
2. It allows you to easily insert Hamilton into any context. Thereby minimizing
   potential migration problems.
