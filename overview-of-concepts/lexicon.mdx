| Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)           | A [directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) is a computer science/mathematics term for representing the world with “nodes” and “edges”, where “edges” only flow in one direction. It is called a graph because it can be drawn and visualized.                  |
| Dataflow                               | The organization of functions and dependencies. This is a DAG – it’s directed (one function is running before the other), acyclic, (there are no cycles, i.e., no function runs before itself), and a graph (it is easily naturally represented by nodes and edges) and can be represented visually. |
| Transform Function, or simply Function | A python function used to represent a Hamilton transform – it can compile to one (in the standard case) or many (with the use of decorators) transforms. See [Hamilton Functions](/overview-of-concepts/hamilton-functions) for more details.                                                        |
| Transform                              | A step in the dataflow DAG representing a computation – usually 1:1 with functions but decorators break that pattern – in which case multiple transforms trace back to a single function.                                                                                                            |
| Node                                   | Synonymous with Transform. A node in the DAG is equivalent to a transform step in the DAG.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Hamilton Driver                        | A specific class written to enable execution of the DAG with certain parameters. This will be your main interface with your Hamilton code. See [Running Your Code](/overview-of-concepts/running-your-code) for more detail.                                                                         |
| “driver” script/code                   | Code that you write to tell Hamilton what the DAG is, what outputs you want, and where the inputs come from.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Config                                 | Data that dictates the way the DAG is constructed. See [Running Your Code](/overview-of-concepts/running-your-code) for more details.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Decorators                             | A python function that modifies another python function in some way. Used in Hamilton to compile functions to sets of transforms. See [Overview of Decorators](/overview-of-concepts/overview-of-decorators) for more detail.                                                                        |
