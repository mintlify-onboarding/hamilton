  "Decorator class to delay evaluation of decorators until after the

```
class hamilton.function_modifiers.resolve(*, when: ResolveAt, decorate_with: Callable[[...], NodeTransformLifecycle])
```

Note: this is a power-user feature, and you have to enable power-user mode! To
do so, you have to add the configuration hamilton.enable_power_user_mode=True to
the config you pass into the driver.

If not, this will break when it tries to instantiate a DAG.

This is particularly useful when you don’t know how you want your functions to
resolve until configuration time. Say, for example, we want to add two series,
and we need to pass the set of series to add as a configuration parameter, as
we’ll be changing it regularly. Without this, you would have to have them as
part of the same dataframe. E.G.

```py
@parameterize_values(
    series_sum_1={"s1": "series_1", "s2": "series_2"},
    series_sum_2={"s1": "series_3", "s2": "series_4"},
)
def summation(df: pd.DataFrame, s1: str, s2: str) -> pd.Series:
    return df[s1] + df[s2]
```

Note that there are a lot of benefits to this code, but it is a workaround for
the fact that we cannot configure the dependencies. With the _@resolve_
decorator, we can actually dynamically set the shape of the DAG based on config:

```py
from hamilton.function_modifiers import resolve, ResolveAt

@resolve(
    when=ResolveAt.CONFIG_AVAILABLE
    decorate_with=lambda first_series_sum, second_series_sum: parameterize_sources(
        series_sum_1={"s1": first_series_sum[0], "s2": second_series_sum[1]},
        series_sum_2={"s1": second_series_sum[1], "s2": second_series_sum[2]},

)
def summation(s1: pd.Series, s2: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:
    return s1 + s2
```

Note how this works:

1. The _decorate_with_ argument is a function that gives you the decorator you
   want to apply. Currently its “hamilton-esque” – while we do not require it to
   be typed, you can use a separate configuration-reoslver function (and include
   type information). This lambda function must return a decorator.
2. The when argument is the point at which you want to resolve the decorator.
   Currently, we only support _ResolveAt.CONFIG_AVAILABLE_, which means that the
   decorator will be resolved at compile time, E.G. when the driver is
   instantiated.
3. This is then run and dynamically resolved.

This is powerful, but the code is uglier. It’s meant to be used in some very
specific cases, E.G. When you want time-series data on a per-column basis (E.G.
once per month), and don’t want that hardcoded. While it is possible to store
this up in a JSON file and run parameterization on the loaded result as a global
variable, it is much cleaner to pass it through the DAG, which is why we support
it. However, since the code goes against one of Hamilton’s primary tenets ( that
all code is highly readable), we require that you enable power_user_mode.

We _highly_ recommend that you put all functions decorated with this in their
own module, keeping it separate from the rest of your functions. This way, you
can import/build DAGs from the rest of your functions without turning on
power-user mode.

```
__init__(*, when: ResolveAt, decorate_with: Callable[[...], NodeTransformLifecycle])
```

Initializes a delayed decorator that gets called at some specific resolution
time.
