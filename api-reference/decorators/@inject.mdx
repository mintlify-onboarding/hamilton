title: "@inject"
description: "@inject allows you to replace parameters with values passed in."

You can think of it as a _@parameterize_ call that has only one
parameterization, the result of which is the name of the function. See the
following examples:

```
class hamilton.function_modifiers.inject(**key_mapping: ParametrizedDependency)
```

```py
import pandas as pd
from function_modifiers import inject, source, value, group

@inject(nums=group(source('a'), value(10), source('b'), value(2)))
def a_plus_10_plus_b_plus_2(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(nums)

This would be equivalent to:

@parameterize(
    a_plus_10_plus_b_plus_2={
        'nums': group(source('a'), value(10), source('b'), value(2))
    })
def sum_numbers(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(nums)
```

Something to note – we currently do not support the case in which the same
parameter is utilized multiple times as an injection. E.G. two lists, a list and
a dict, two sources, etc…

This is considered undefined behavior, and should be avoided.

```
__init__(**key_mapping: ParametrizedDependency)
```

Instantiates an @inject decorator with the given key_mapping.

#### Parameters

<ParamField body="key_mapping">
  A dictionary of string to dependency spec. This is the same as the input
  mapping in @parameterize.
</ParamField>
