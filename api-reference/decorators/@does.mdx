title: "@does"
description:
  "@does is a decorator that essentially allows you to run a function over all
  the input parameters."
---

```
class hamilton.function_modifiers.does(replacing_function: Callable, **argument_mapping: Union[str, List[str]])
```

So you canâ€™t pass any old function to @does, instead the function passed has to
take any amount of inputs and process them all in the same way.

```py
import pandas as pd
from hamilton.function_modifiers import does
import internal_package_with_logic

def sum_series(**series: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:
    '''This function takes any number of inputs and sums them all together.'''
    ...

@does(sum_series)
def D_XMAS_GC_WEIGHTED_BY_DAY(D_XMAS_GC_WEIGHTED_BY_DAY_1: pd.Series,
                              D_XMAS_GC_WEIGHTED_BY_DAY_2: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:
    '''Adds D_XMAS_GC_WEIGHTED_BY_DAY_1 and D_XMAS_GC_WEIGHTED_BY_DAY_2'''
    pass

@does(internal_package_with_logic.identity_function)
def copy_of_x(x: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:
    '''Just returns x'''
    pass
```

The example here is a function, that all that it does, is sum all the parameters
together. So we can annotate it with the @does decorator and pass it the
sum_series function. The @does decorator is currently limited to just allow
functions that consist only of one argument, a generic \*\*kwargs.

```
__init__(replacing_function: Callable, **argument_mapping: Union[str, List[str]])
```

Constructor for a modifier that replaces the annotated functions functionality
with something else. Right now this has a very strict validation requirements to
make compliance with the framework easy.

#### Parameters

<ParamField body="replacing_function">
  The function to replace the original function with.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="argument_mapping">
  A mapping of argument name in the replacing function to argument name in the
  decorating function.
</ParamField>
