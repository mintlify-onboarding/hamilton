title: "Result Builders"
description:
  "Result builders help you augment what is returned by the driver’s execute()
  function."
---

Here we list what is available:

## Generic

```
class hamilton.base.ResultMixin
```

Abstract base class housing the static function.

Why a static function? That’s because certain frameworks can only pickle a
static function, not an entire object.

All result builders should inherit from this class and implement the
build_result function.

    ```
    abstract static build_result(**outputs: Dict[str, Any]) → Any
    ```

        This function builds the result given the computed values.

```
class hamilton.base.DictResult
```

Simple function that returns the dict of column -> value results.

It returns the results as a dictionary, where the keys map to outputs requested,
and values map to what was computed for those values.

Use this when you want to:

<Info>
  1. debug dataflows. 2. have heterogeneous return types. 3. Want to manually
  transform the result into something of your choosing.
</Info>

```py
from hamilton import base, driver
dict_builder = base.DictResult()
adapter = base.SimplePythonGraphAdapter(dict_builder)
dr =  driver.Driver(config, *modules, adapter=adapter)
dict_result = dr.execute([...], inputs=...)
```

```
static build_result(**outputs: Dict[str, Any]) → Dict
```

This function builds a simple dict of output -> computed values.

## Pandas

```
class hamilton.base.PandasDataFrameResult
```

Mixin for building a pandas dataframe from the result.

It returns the results as a Pandas Dataframe, where the columns map to outputs
requested, and values map to what was computed for those values. Note: this only
works if the computed values are pandas series, or scalar values.

Use this when you want to create a pandas dataframe.

```py Example
from hamilton import base, driver
default_builder = base.PandasDataFrameResult()
adapter = base.SimplePythonGraphAdapter(default_builder)
dr =  driver.Driver(config, *modules, adapter=adapter)
df = dr.execute([...], inputs=...)
```

```
static build_result(**outputs: Dict[str, Any]) → DataFrame
```

Builds a Pandas DataFrame from the outputs.

This function will check the index types of the outputs, and log warnings if
they don’t match. The behavior of pd.Dataframe(outputs) is that it will do an
outer join based on indexes of the Series passed in.

#### Parameters

<ParamField body="outputs">the outputs to build a dataframe from.</ParamField>

```
class hamilton.base.StrictIndexTypePandasDataFrameResult
```

A ResultBuilder that produces a dataframe only if the index types match exactly.

Note: If there is no index type on some outputs, e.g. the value is a scalar, as
long as there exists a single pandas index type, no error will be thrown,
because a dataframe can be easily created.

Use this when you want to create a pandas dataframe from the outputs, but you
want to ensure that the index types match exactly.

To use:

```py
from hamilton import base, driver
strict_builder = base.StrictIndexTypePandasDataFrameResult()
adapter = base.SimplePythonGraphAdapter(strict_builder)
dr =  driver.Driver(config, *modules, adapter=adapter)
df = dr.execute([...], inputs=...)  # this will now error if index types mismatch.
```

```
static build_result(**outputs: Dict[str, Any]) → DataFrame
```

Builds a Pandas DataFrame from the outputs.

This function will check the index types of the outputs, and log warnings if
they don’t match. The behavior of pd.Dataframe(outputs) is that it will do an
outer join based on indexes of the Series passed in.

#### Parameters

<ParamField body="outputs">the outputs to build a dataframe from.</ParamField>

## Numpy

```
class hamilton.base.NumpyMatrixResult
```

Mixin for building a Numpy Matrix from the result of walking the graph.

All inputs to the build_result function are expected to be numpy arrays.

```py
from hamilton import base, driver
adapter = base.SimplePythonGraphAdapter(base.NumpyMatrixResult())
dr = driver.Driver(config, *modules, adapter=adapter)
numpy_matrix = dr.execute([...], inputs=...)
```

```
static build_result(**outputs: Dict[str, Any]) → matrix
```

Builds a numpy matrix from the passed in, inputs.

Note: this does not check that the inputs are all numpy arrays/array like
things.

#### Parameters

<ParamField body="outputs">function_name -> np.array.</ParamField>

#### Returns

numpy matrix

## Polars

```
class hamilton.plugins.polars_implementations.PolarsDataFrameResult
```

A ResultBuilder that produces a polars dataframe.

Use this when you want to create a polars dataframe from the outputs. Caveat:
you need to ensure that the length of the outputs is the same, otherwise you
will get an error; mixed outputs aren’t that well handled.

To use:

```py
from hamilton import base, driver
from hamilton.plugins import polars_extensions
polars_builder = polars_extensions.PolarsDataFrameResult()
adapter = base.SimplePythonGraphAdapter(polars_builder)
dr =  driver.Driver(config, *modules, adapter=adapter)
df = dr.execute([...], inputs=...)  # returns polars dataframe
```

Note: this is just a first attempt at something for Polars. Think it should
handle more? Come chat/open a PR!

```
build_result(**outputs: Dict[str, Union[Series, DataFrame, Any]]) → DataFrame
```

This is the method that Hamilton will call to build the final result. It will
pass in the results of the requested outputs that you passed in to the execute()
method.

Note: this function could do smarter things; looking for contributions here!

#### Parameters

<ParamField body="outputs">The results of the requested outputs.</ParamField>

#### Returns

a polars DataFrame.
